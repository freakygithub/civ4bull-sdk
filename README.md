# civ4bull-sdk
Originally forked from dguenms/beyond-the-sword-sdk

Added BULL DLL code on top of this and merged the makefiles

Steps to use (I need to test this)
1) Follow the original SDK setup directions can be found on this thread: https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/the-easiest-way-to-compile-a-new-dll.608137/
2) Download and install BUG in CustomAssets
3) Downlaod and install BULL the CustomAssets copy way
4) Use this SDK to build a new CvGameCoreDLL file
